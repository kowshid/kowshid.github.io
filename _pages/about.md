Hi! I'm Ahsan. I have completed my undergrad from [BUET](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/) and my major was in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/). Currently, I am persuing my master's in Applied Computer Science at [Grand Valley State University](https://www.gvsu.edu/computing), where I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant as well.

I am a software engineer with over 4 years of experience, specializing in the fintech industry. My skill set covers Java, Spring Boot, Redis, AWS and more. I have a strong background in building scalable and secure systems around cloud components, ensuring that performance and reliability are prioritized in every project.

*"Large systems are nothing short of magic."*
