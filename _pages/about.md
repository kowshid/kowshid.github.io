Hello! I am Ahsan. A software engineer and Leo Messi fan.

I am currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s in <a href="https://www.gvsu.edu/catalog/program/master-of-science-in-applied-computer-science.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applied Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.gvsu.edu/computing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GVSU</a>, where I also work as a Graduate Research Assistant. I earned my undergraduate degree in <a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Computer Science and Engineering</a> from <a href="https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BUET</a>.

Over the past four years, I have built my career in the fintech and telecom industries. My expertise spans reactive programming, cloud infrastructure, software development lifecycle, and more. I specialize in designing and delivering scalable, secure systems on the cloud, with a strong focus on performance, reliability, and real-world impact.
